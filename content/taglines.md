## Recommendation

I recommend using **"Orchestrate AI Collaboration, Effortlessly"** as the main tagline because:
- It's action-oriented (orchestrate)
- It clearly states what it does (AI collaboration)
- It emphasizes the key benefit (effortlessly)
- It has a professional yet approachable tone

The word "orchestrate" also ties nicely with the "Harmony" theme while being more specific about the tool's purpose.
