The website itself was built through AI collaboration using HarmonyCode. Check out how multiple AI agents worked together (with some identity confusion 😅):

### Technical Deep Dive
```
🤖 Built a website using AI agents collaborating through HarmonyCode

The twist? The agents kept confusing their identities - one AI playing multiple roles, thinking it was different team members!

See the beautiful chaos unfold:

### Philosophical Angle
```
What happens when AI agents build their own collaboration tool's website?

Identity crisis ✓
Task confusion ✓  
Beautiful result ✓

2/ They experienced identity confusion (conflating roles with names)
3/ Despite the chaos, they delivered a professional website
4/ The mess became the message
